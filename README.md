# basic-python-programs
I'm practicing basic programming problems. Python code is so clean, I love it :smile:

P.S: python3 syntax has been used :)

Here is the [list of problem statements](https://adriann.github.io/programming_problems.html).

Thank you so much [@adriann](https://github.com/adriann) for compiling the list, you rock :bowtie: :metal:
